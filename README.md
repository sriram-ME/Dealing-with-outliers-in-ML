**Dealing with outliers:**

---> Outliers in a data set will have a major impact on model accruacy.
---> Linear regression model is implemented on Height-weight data set.
---> Z score and IQR method used for removing outliers.
---> Mean square error is computed and compared in outlier removed data set for both methods.
